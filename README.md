# Brain- Oop

BrainF is an esoteric coding language, typically used for jokes. It uses minimalistic syntax for basic tasks. This is an ASCII text to BrainF converter and a BrainF compiler.

| Commands | Syntax |
|----------|--------|
| `\+`     | Increments the current index |
| `\-`     | Decrements the current index |
| `\>`     | Increments the cursor |
| `<`      | Decrements the cursor |
| `.`      | Prints the ASCII value of the current index |
| `[`      | Starts a loop to be run until the current index is equal to 0 |
| `]`      | End of loop (loop iterates again until discontinuation requirement is met) |

Whitespace has no meaning and invalid syntax (such as alhpanumerical characters) will not be compiled.
